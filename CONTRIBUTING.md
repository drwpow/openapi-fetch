# Contributing

Thanks for being willing to contribute! üôè

**Working on your first Pull Request (PR)?** [Egghead has a great free video introduction](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Open issues

Please check out the [the open issues](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-fetch/issues). Issues labelled [**Help Wanted**](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-fetch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and [**Good First Issue**](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-fetch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are especially good to help with.

Contributing doesn‚Äôt have to be in code! Simply answering questions in open issues, or providing workarounds, is just as important a contribution as making pull requests.

## Opening a Pull Request

Pull requests are **welcome** for this repo! Bugfixes will always be accepted, though in some cases some small changes may be requested.

However, if adding a feature or breaking change, please **open an issue first to discuss.** This ensures no time or work is wasted writing code that won‚Äôt be accepted to the project (see [Project Goals](./README.md#-project-goals)). Undiscussed feature work may be rejected at the discretion of the maintainers.

### Setup

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
2. [Fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and clone your copy locally
3. Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies

### Writing code

Create a new branch for your PR with `git checkout -b your-branch-name`. Add the relevant code as well as docs and tests. When you push everything up (`git push`), navigate back to your repo GitHub and you should see a prompt to open a new PR.

While best practices for commit messages are encouraged (e.g. start with an imperative verb, keep it short, use the body if needed), this repo doesn‚Äôt follow any specific guidelines like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Clarity is favored over strict rules. Changelogs are generated separately from git (see [the Changelogs section](#changelogs)

### Writing the PR

**Please fill out the template!** It‚Äôs a very lightweight template üôÇ.

### Changelogs

The changelog is generated via [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets), and is separate from Git commit messages and pull request titles. To write a human-readable changelog for your changes, run:

```
npx changeset
```

This will ask if it‚Äôs a `patch`, `minor`, or `major` change ([semver](https://semver.org/)), along with a plain description of what you did. Commit this new file along with the rest of your PR, and during the next release this will go into the official changelog!

### CI

All PRs must fix lint errors, and all tests must pass. PRs will not be merged until all CI checks are ‚Äúgreen‚Äù (‚úÖ).

#### Tests

This library uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. There‚Äôs a great [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZixuanChen.vitest-explorer) you can optionally use if you‚Äôd like in-editor debugging tools.

To run the entire test suite, run:

```bash
npm test
```

To run an individual test:

```bash
npm test -- [partial filename]
```

To start the entire test suite in watch mode:

```bash
npx vitest
```
